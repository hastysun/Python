## Unit 1 Lesson 2 - More with Strings
## Computer Programming II - Gavin Weiss

## Code

# We can use escape sequences to give us
# More control over our text

print("I like programming because I am a nerd")
# \n skips a line

print("\nI like to skip lines")
# \n must go inside quotes

print("\n\nI like to skip two lines")

# \t is a horizontal tab
print("\n")

print("\t I like to make horizontal tabs")

print("\n\t I like to skip lines and make horizontal tabs")

# We have escape sequences that help us add quotes to strings

# \' prints a single quote
# \" prints a double quote
# \\ will print a backslash

print("\n Blake admitted, \"Mr. Toulson is clearly the best teacher.\"")

# Concatenating strings means joining strings together
# To create new strings

print("\n")
print("May the Force" + " be with you")
